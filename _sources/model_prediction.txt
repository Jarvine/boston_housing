Model Prediction
================





Question 10
-----------

*Using grid search on the entire dataset, what is the optimal  ``max_depth`` parameter for your model? How does this result compare to your intial intuition?*

**Hint: ** Run the code block below to see the max depth produced by your optimized model.


.. code::

    Final model optimal parameters: {'max_depth': 1}
    
    



The optimal max-depth parameter was 1, which did not match my intuitive interpretation, as I thought that the more complex models did better, and specifically that a max-depth of 6 was optimal for this data set.

Question 11
-----------

*With your parameter-tuned model, what is the best selling price for your client's home? How does this selling price compare to the basic statistics you calculated on the dataset?*

.. '


.. code::

    Predicted value of client's home: $19,933.72
    Median Value - predicted: $1,266.28
    
    



My three chosen features (`lower_status`, `nitric_oxide`, and `rooms`) seemed to indicate that the client's house might be a lower-valued house, and the predicted value was about $1,266 less than the median median-value, so our model predicts that the client has a below-median-value house.

Question 12
-----------

*In a few sentences, discuss whether you would use this model or not to predict the selling price of future clients' homes in the Greater Boston area.*

While the model does seem to predict a reasonable prec, I don't think that I would use this model (exclusively). The optimal model with a max-depth of 1 showed a high-bias and I suspect this underfits the data. I think this might be a good baseline model, but I would need to see other models before feeling confident that the predictions are valid.
