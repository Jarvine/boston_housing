Question 10
-----------

*Using grid search on the entire data set, what is the optimal  ``max_depth`` parameter for your model? How does this result compare to your initial intuition?*

While a max-depth of 3 was the most common best-parameter, the max-depth of 5 was the median max-depth, had the highest median score, and had the highest overall score, so I will say that the optimal `max_depth` parameter is 5. This is slightly lower than my guess of 6, but doesn't seem too far off, although a max-depth of 7 seems to be a slight improvement over 6 as well.

Question 11
-----------

*With your parameter-tuned model, what is the best selling price for your client's home? How does this selling price compare to the basic statistics you calculated on the dataset?*

.. '


.. code::

    Predicted value of client's home: $18,816.67
    Median Value - predicted: $2,383.33
    
    



My three chosen features (`lower_status`, `nitric_oxide`, and `rooms`) seemed to indicate that the client's house might be a lower-valued house, and the predicted value was about $1,266 less than the median median-value, so our model predicts that the client has a below-median-value house.

Question 12
-----------

*In a few sentences, discuss whether you would use this model or not to predict the selling price of future clients' homes in the Greater Boston area.*

.. '

I think that this model seems to make a reasonable prediction for the given data (Boston Suburbs in 1970), but I'm not sure that I agree that the data for an entire suburb is necessarily generalizable for a specific unit within a suburb. What this model predicts is that a suburb with attributes similar to the client's would have our predicted median value, but within each suburb there would likely be a bit of variance. I would also think that separating out the upper-class houses would give a better model for this particular client, given the sub-median values for his or her features, and the right-skew of the data. If the goal was to predict median prices for suburbs, then I would use this model, but not for individual sales.
