Project 1 - Predicting Housing Prices
=====================================

A pdf version is available :download:`here <boston_housing.pdf>` and the repository for the source of this document is `here <https://github.com/necromuralist/boston_housing>`_.

This is Project One from Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree program. It uses the `UCI Boston Housing Dataset <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing>`_ to build a model to predict housing prices for Boston Suburbs. The dataset was originally created to study the problems associated with trying to infer the value of clean air by looking at housing prices (Harrison and Rubinfeld 1978) but is used here to predict the value of a hypothetical client's house based on the associated values for this house.
